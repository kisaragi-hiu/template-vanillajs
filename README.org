* My pure JavaScript Template

- TailwindCSS + PostCSS
- Babel + Webpack (might as well set it up)
- entry point:
  - JS: src/main.js
  - CSS: src/main.css
  - I assume the main HTML file to be static. Edit =dist/index.html= directly.
- Built files:
  - JS: dist/built.js
  - CSS: dist/built.css
  - HTML: dist/index.html

If you (I) need anything more complex, use a proper framework instead.

** Usage

1. =npm install=
2. Maybe generate a favicon with realfavicongenerator
3. Fill in HTML title, description, author, keywords
4. Bring in web fonts if you want

Commands:

- make dev :: start a dev server; actually a combination of
  - make watch-js :: dev server & auto javascript rebuild
  - make watch-css :: auto css rebuild
  - make open-browser :: open page in browser if it's not already. Only avoids opening the page again in Firefox because I didn't bother implementing it for other browsers. See [[file:firefox-page-opened.py]].
- make clean :: delete every built file
  - make clean-all :: also delete =node_modules=
- make build :: build for production
